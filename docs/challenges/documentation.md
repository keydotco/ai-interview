# Documentation Gap Challenge

## Overview
This challenge focuses on understanding and documenting a complex utility in the codebase. The `DataTransformer` utility in `src/utils/dataTransformer.js` is a powerful but poorly documented component that needs comprehensive documentation to be usable by other developers.

## Challenge Description
The `DataTransformer` utility provides flexible data transformation capabilities but lacks proper documentation. Your task is to:

1. Understand how the utility works by examining the code and example usage
2. Create comprehensive documentation for the utility, including:
   - Class overview and purpose
   - Constructor options
   - Method descriptions with parameters and return values
   - Transformation schema format and options
   - Usage examples for common scenarios

## Files to Examine
- `src/utils/dataTransformer.js`: The main utility class with minimal documentation
- `src/examples/dataTransformerExample.js`: Example usage of the utility

## Requirements
Your documentation should include:

### Class Documentation
- Purpose and overview of the `DataTransformer` class
- Explanation of when and why to use this utility

### Constructor Options
- Document all available options for the constructor
- Explain default values and their implications

### Method Documentation
For each public method:
- Method signature with parameter types
- Description of what the method does
- Return value description
- Example usage

### Schema Documentation
- Explain the schema format used for transformations
- Document all supported transformation types
- Provide examples of different schema configurations

### Usage Patterns
- Document common usage patterns
- Provide examples for different scenarios

## Deliverables
Create a markdown file named `dataTransformer.md` in the `docs/utils` directory with your comprehensive documentation.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your documentation will be evaluated based on:
- Accuracy and completeness
- Clarity and organization
- Inclusion of helpful examples
- Understanding of the utility's purpose and functionality

## Hints
- Start by examining the example usage to understand the basic functionality
- Look for patterns in how the transformation schemas are structured
- Pay attention to the different transformation types supported
- Consider edge cases and how they are handled
- Think about how you would explain this utility to a new developer

## Stretch Goals
If you complete the basic documentation quickly:
1. Create a more comprehensive set of examples showing advanced usage patterns
2. Suggest improvements to the API design
3. Identify potential bugs or edge cases in the implementation
4. Create JSDoc-style comments that could be added directly to the source code
