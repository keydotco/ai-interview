# System Architecture

## Overview
The AI Interview project is a Node.js Express application designed with a modular architecture to facilitate various coding challenges. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. API Layer
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and HTTP methods
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Middleware**: Process requests before they reach route handlers
  - Authentication
  - Validation
  - Error handling
  - Logging

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Services**: Implement core business logic
- **Models**: Define data structures and validation rules

### 3. Data Access Layer
- **Repositories**: Handle data storage and retrieval
- **Data Models**: Define database schema

### 4. Utility Layer
- **Helpers**: Reusable utility functions
- **Constants**: Application-wide constants and configurations

## Key Components

### Express Application
The main Express application is configured in `src/app.js` and serves as the entry point for HTTP requests.

### Middleware Chain
Requests flow through a series of middleware functions before reaching the route handlers:
1. Request parsing (body-parser)
2. Request logging
3. Authentication (when required)
4. Route-specific middleware
5. Controller action
6. Error handling middleware

### Error Handling
The application implements a centralized error handling mechanism:
- Custom error classes for different types of errors
- Error handling middleware to catch and process errors
- Consistent error response format

### Configuration Management
Application configuration is managed through:
- Environment variables (loaded from `.env` file)
- Configuration files in the `config/` directory
- Environment-specific configurations

### Testing Strategy
The application includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for optimization challenges

## Data Flow

1. Client sends HTTP request to an API endpoint
2. Request passes through middleware chain
3. Route handler delegates to appropriate controller
4. Controller validates input and calls service methods
5. Service implements business logic, possibly interacting with models
6. Response flows back through the middleware chain
7. Formatted response is sent to the client

## Deployment
The application can be deployed as:
- Standalone Node.js application
- Docker container using the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
